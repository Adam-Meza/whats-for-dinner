# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
For this project I built an application that is able to solve a daily problem faced by every human neing; "Whats for dinner?". With the simple click of a button users are able generate a random suggestion for either a Main, Side or Dessert Dish. Users are also able to favorite items, which can be viewed on a seperate page. Additionally users can remove their favorites by double clicking in the their names.

### Context:
The project took about 14 hours over the course of 5 days. It tested my knowledge of using Javascript and CSS to manipulate HTML in the DOM. It specifically served as means of aqcuiring experience with using CSS flexboxes to meet a given comp. It was completed as the Week 3 solo project of the Turing School Program.

### Learning Goals:
The learning goals of this project were to gain experience creating an application that utilzies CSS, HTML, and Javascript. It was also to learn and develop my own programming style; how do I plan for a large project, what steps do I take when problems arise, etc. 

### Wins + Challenges:
I'd say the biggest win was solving issues with my CSS. I did a lot of research to better understand the behaviors of flex properties and ultimately was able to create the desires outcome. Another win would be using event bubbling to make all the favorite items deletable.
