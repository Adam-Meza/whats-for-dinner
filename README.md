# What's for Dinner?

### Context:
The project took about 14 hours over the course of 5 days. It tested my knowledge of using javascript and CSS to manipulate HTML in the DOM.

### Learning Goals:
The learning goals of this project were to gain experience creating an application that utilzies CSS, HTML, and Javascript. It was also to learn and develop my own programming style; how do I plan for a large project, what steps do I take when problems arise, etc. 

### Wins + Challenges:
Working with CSS proved to be a challenge. At one point my display function was broken and a few hours were spent trying to refactor it so it worked. solving that was definitely a win. Additionally setting up the comp for the MVP took a very large portion of the time spent on this project.
